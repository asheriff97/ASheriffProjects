## Alex Sheriff's Projects
The following are a list of notable projects that I have completed during my stay at Monmouth University.

### Length of Stay Hospital Project
This project was part of my Graduate Assistantship at Monmouth University as I was studying for my M.S. in Software Engineering. The general purpose is to use Machine Learning models to predict how many days a patient would stay at a hospital based on criteria like APR DRG Code, CCS Diagnostic Code, CCS Procedure Code, and others. I researched and applied concepts like Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE, One Hot Encoding, and Feature Analysis to achieve an 76% accuracy with a Random Forest Tree Supervised learning model. Other models used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Ada Boost, and Gradient Boost. With the guidance of my supervisor, we were able to publish an IEEE paper which can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9736254. (This paper does not discuss the results we found incorporating SMOTE and One Hot Encoding. That paper will be published at an later date)

### Powershell Trojan
This is a project I worked on with a partner in my CyberSecurity class at Monmouth University. The general idea is that we send an email to a individual containing a .exe file. This file takes you to a website with a cookie recipe, and in the background writes a .cmd file to your OS Startup folder. Next time you restart or turn on your computer, a pop-up will occur displaying "You're a Jerk" which you'll have to click through 6 times before it goes away. Although very simple, it demonstrates how invasive a simple program could be. A demonstration of how this Trojan works can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMx90HvHN9Y&feature=emb_logo), furthermore a technical report and presentation powerpoint can be found in the project folder.

### Idle Adventure Mockup
Idle Adventure is a mobile game concept. Designed in Adobe XD, this was my first experience designing an app in Adobe XD. A functional product does not exist. "Idle Adventure is a game concept created by Alex Sheriff for his SE-402 Class at Monmouth University. You can gather supplies to upgrade your party members, and send those party members out on quests. Furthermore, as you are playing you will be subjected to "encounters" which will give you an opportunity to gain more supply, or lose some. Have fun!" (Taken from the 'Game Statistics' Panel)

### YogaGuruRails
This was a group project I worked on with two other students in my Software Process Improvement (SE403) class at Monmouth University. We worked with a grad assistant acting as a client who wanted a website for her yoga company. We learned a lot about software development and working with clients and the overall life cycle of a software product. The site was made with Ruby on Rails.
