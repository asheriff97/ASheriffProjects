My Personal Projects

Powershell Trojan --- This is a project I worked on with a partner in my CyberSecurity class at Monmouth University. The general idea is that we send an email to a individual containing a .exe file. This file takes you to a website with a cookie recipe, and in the background writes a .cmd file to your OS Startup folder. Next time you restart or turn on your computer, a pop-up will occur displaying "You're a Jerk" which you'll have to click through 6 times before it goes away. Although very simple, it demonstrates how invasive a simple program could be. A demonstration of how this Trojan works can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMx90HvHN9Y&feature=emb_logo, furthermore a technical report and presentation powerpoint can be found in the project folder.

YogaGuruRails --- This was a group project I worked on with two other students in my Software Process Improvement (SE403) class at Monmouth University. We worked with a grad assistant acting as a client who wanted a website for her yoga company. We learned a lot about software development and working with clients and the overall life cycle of a software product. The site was made with Ruby on Rails.
