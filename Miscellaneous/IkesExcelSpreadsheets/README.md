## Ike's Spreadsheets README
The following spreadsheets were designed and developed by me to be used by my employer/manager at the restaurant Ike's Big Mouth.

### IkesDrinkHelper
This spreadsheet was designed to assist my manager when taking inventory for drinks. The user pre-sets the minimum amount of drink cases they want for each drink after a delivery, e.g. Poland Spring Water 5 cases. After the minimum amount has been established, the user simply needs to count the amount of drinks they currently have in the "This Wk" column, and my spreadsheet will calculate the quantity to be ordered and highlight the drink name to be ordered. Additionally, my manager requested that he'd like a MAXIMUM of drinks cases to be on hand at any given time, which is also calculated to the right of the main "order menu". When the drink cases exceed a specific number, the cell will turn red. Additionally I set up a macro-button that transfers the column from "this wk" to "last wk" when starting a new drink order. The general change in drinks week-to-week are calculated as well. I used conditional formatting, conditional functions, and one macro in the process of creating this spreadsheet.

### IkesSchedulePlanner
This spreadsheet uses simple functions for the manager to plan how many hours each employee may have at the end of the week. It's to be used in conjuction with the IkesTimeCards spreadsheet at the end of the week to ensure an employee is working the hours they're scheduled.

### IkesSuperBowl2024
SuperBowl is the busiest day of the year at Ike's. We only accept catering orders in advance for the day, and no walk-in/take-out orders are accepted the day of. This spreadsheet was designed for us to accurately plan the amount of stock we'll need to succesfully process each catering order the day of, as well as having one place the locate customer names/numbers. We offered 2 "pre-packaged" catering plans, AFC and NFC packages, which we could select on the spreadsheet and it automatically populate the respective cells. The total for boneless/wings/sandwiches/salads/etc were calculated automatically for us to be prepared the day of for superbowl.

### IkesTimeCards
This spreadsheet is for my employer to calculate our exact end of week hours for pay-day. At Ike's we get a 45 minute paid break, although we still clock out for it. This is to make sure that employees arent spending above 45 minutes for their break. If they spend 5 or more minutes extra on their break, the cell turns red. Any minute above the allocated 45 gets subtracted from that days total time worked. Each days total time gets summed for the weeks total.

### IkesTipCalculator
Tips are shared among every employee at Ike's and distributed when we obtain $1000 dollars in tips. The only thing required by the user is the knowledge of how many hours each employee has worked since the last time tips were distributed. The employees hours are totaled, and converted to a percentage, and then that percentage is taken from $1000 to calculate tips owed. E.g. If 10 employees worked 10 hours each since the last time tips were distributed, then each employee would be entitled to 10% of the total tips, or $100.
